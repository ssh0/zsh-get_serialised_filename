# zsh-get_seriarised_filename

useful function to get serialised filename

# Usage

In your shell script, sometimes you want save a file in '/path/to/save'
with serial-numbered file name.
Assume that the structure of '/path/to/save' is now

```
    path
    └── to
        └── save
            ├── 01_file
            ├── 02_file
            ├── 04_file
            ├── file_001.txt
            ├── file_002.txt
            └── file_003.txt
```

Then you can get the serial-numberd file name like below:

1. if you want to create "file_004.txt"

```
someoperation > "\$(get_serialised_filename -d "/path/to/save" -b "file_" -e "txt")"
```

(equal)

```
someoperation > "/path/to/save/file_004.txt"
```

2. if you want to create "05_file"

```
someoperation > "\$(get_serialised_filename -d "/path/to/save" -n 2 -a "_file")"
```

(equal)

```
someoperation > "/path/to/save/05_file"
```

3. if you want to create "/path/to/other/newfile_001.md"

```
someoperation > "\$(get_serialised_filename -d "/path/to/other" -b "newfile_" -e "md")"
```

(equal)

```
someoperation > "/path/to/other/newfile_001.md"
```

But this may fail because 'other' directory doesn't exist yet.
This script only returns filename but doesn't anything except that.
